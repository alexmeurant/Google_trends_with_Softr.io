# Google_trends_with_Softr.io
A ``Google Trends`` clone with **Softr**, **Airtable** and **Zapier**!

In this project carried out with a NoCodeDevs's tutorial, I was able to discover the speed and power of NoCode tools capable of communicating with each other.

Thus, I was able to create a zap that fetches RSS data from Google Trends, to feed a table created on Airtable. Finally, I customized a template on Softr.io to display this data on the site below in just a few steps. Simple and effective.
